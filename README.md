# FHIR IG PGHD
## Created a comprehensive FHIR Implementation Guide for wearable device data with:

### Core profiles:

* WearableDevice,

* WearableObservation (base profile),

* ActivityObservation,

* WearableVitalSigns,

* SleepObservation,

### Value sets and code systems for:


#### Device types
  * Measurement methods
  * Activity metrics
  * Vital signs
  * Sleep metrics

#### Documentation pages:

  * Home page with overview
  
  * Supported devices
 
  * Profile documentation

The IG uses FHIR R4 (4.0.1) and includes proper terminology bindings to LOINC, SNOMED CT, and UCUM. 

You can build it using FHIR Shorthand (FSH) compiler (SUSHI).
